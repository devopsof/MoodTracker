## 🎭 What Your AI Bot Can Do

### **Intelligent Conversations**
```
User: "I'm feeling overwhelmed at work lately"
AI: "Work stress can really weigh on us. I noticed you've been tracking some challenging days recently with an intensity of 7. What aspect of work feels most overwhelming right now - is it the workload, deadlines, or maybe relationships with colleagues?"
```

### **Crisis Detection**
```
User: "I don't want to be here anymore"
AI: "I'm really concerned about you. Please reach out for immediate help: Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or text 'HELLO' to 741741. You matter, and there are people who want to help. Would you like to talk about what's making you feel this way?"
```

### **Mood-Aware Support**
```
User: "Bad day today"
AI: "I can see you're having a tough time - your mood entry shows you're at a 2/5 with high intensity. Sometimes when we're struggling, it helps to ground ourselves. Can you name 3 things you can see around you right now?"
```

### **Evidence-Based Techniques**
- **CBT**: Cognitive reframing for negative thoughts
- **Mindfulness**: Grounding exercises for anxiety
- **Behavioral**: Activity suggestions for depression
- **Validation**: Emotional support and normalization
