## How It Currently Works

The AI therapist currently uses **advanced simulated responses** that are:
- **Therapeutic & Empathetic**: Based on CBT and mindfulness techniques
- **Mood-Aware**: Adapts responses based on your recent mood entries
- **Crisis-Safe**: Detects urgent situations and provides resources
- **Contextual**: References your photos, tags, and mood patterns

## Optional: Upgrade to Claude API (FREE)

Want even more advanced AI responses? You can optionally connect to Anthropic's Claude API:

### Step 1: Get Free Claude API Access
1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get $5 free credit (enough for thousands of therapy conversations)
4. Copy your API key from the dashboard

### Step 2: Add API Key to Your App
Add this to your environment:
```bash
# In your deployment environment, set:
